# Use of AI in Textures

## Explicit Statement of AI Usage

In this project, AI was explicitly used in the creation of textures. The following outlines the specific ways AI contributed:

- **Texture Generation:** AI-based tools were used to generate original textures.

## AI-Assisted Texture Mixing (Additional Features)

AI was also utilized to create mixed textures by blending different texture sources.
We learned the `mix()` function in vertex helipad.frag from AI, the rest of the logic was self implemented.

## Examples

- **Helipad Texture:**

  This texture represents a helipad landing area, generated using AI to create realistic surface details and markings.
